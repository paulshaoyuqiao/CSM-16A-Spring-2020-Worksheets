\begin{enumerate}
\item Draw the space on the figure above that is represented by the span of all the column vectors in $A$. Also draw the space covered by the span of all the row vectors in $A$. What dimension are these spaces?

\sol{
The 1 dimensional space for the column space is a line on the $x_2=x_1$ axis (so a diagonal line that goes perfectly northeast, intersecting the origin along the way). The 1 dimensional space for the row space is the line $x_2=2x_1$
}

\note{
Remember that the lines that are drawn are infinite, make sure to make a point of that.
}

\item Consider some arbitrary vector $\vec{v}=\begin{bmatrix}v_1\\v_2\end{bmatrix}$. Write out the product $\m{A}\vec{v}$ in terms of $v_1$, $v_2$, and the columns of $\m{A}$.

\sol{
\[
    \m{A}\vec{v} = v_1\begin{bmatrix}1\\1\end{bmatrix} + v_2\begin{bmatrix}2\\2\end{bmatrix}
\]
}

\note{
    Make sure to make sure students notice the implications of the above answer, that this assures that the result of $Av$ is ALWAYS in the span of the column vectors of $A$.
}

\item We have talked about how matrices like $\m{A}$ have no inverse. Give a geometric explanation for why this is the case. 

\sol{
If we are given some point on the line for the colspace from part (a), we do not know where it came from. For example, if you gave the point given by $\m{A}\vec{x}$, you have no way of knowing that it came from $\vec{x}$. For example, $\vec{x} = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 2
\end{bmatrix}^T$ also works.
}

\note{
Make sure students see the ties between independence/invertibility and the geometry.
}

\item Consider all points $\vec{y}$ such that $\m{A}\vec{y} = 0$ Draw the space that the $\vec{y}$'s will make up. What do you notice geometrically? What is the dimension of this space?

\sol{
This line should be a straight line that is perpendicular to the line for the row space from part (a). It is a space of dimension 1
}

\note{
Discuss relationship between colspace and dimension, like how they always add up to the total size of the space.
