Description: Show why in some cases you would want to use two inverting op amps in a row. Learn how to design circuits using nested inverting op amps.

\begin{enumerate}

\item{What is the range of values that we can scale $V_{in}$ by when using a non-inverting op amp? (What are possible values for the gain?)
}

\sol{
Recall that when using a non-inverting op amp, the equation for $V_{out}$  is $V_{in}(1 + \frac{R_2}{R_1})$; the gain is represented by $(1 + \frac{R_2}{R_1})$. We can choose any values for resistance from [0, $\infty$); then, the minimum gain would be 1 if we chose $R_2 = 0$; the maximum gain approaches infinity as we choose some very large $R_2$ and/or a very small $R_1$. Hence, the range of gains is from 1 to infinity, and our range of values for $V_{out}$ is [$V_{in}$, $\infty$).
}

\note{Note: we do not want to choose negative resistance values.}

\item{
What is the range of values that we can scale $V_{in}$ by when using an inverting op amp? (What are the possible values for the gain?)
}

\sol{
Recall that when using an inverting op amp, the equation for $V_{out}$ is $-V_{in}\frac{R_2}{R_1}$; the gain is represented by $-\frac{R_2}{R_1}$. Again, we can choose any values for resistance from [0, $\infty$); then, the minimum absolute value scaling would be 0 if we chose $R_2 = 0$; the maximum absolute value scaling approaches infinity as we choose some very large $R_2$ and/or a very small $R_1$. Hence, the range of gains is from 0 to -$\infty$, and our range of values for $V_{out}$ is also ($-\infty$, 0].

}

\item{
What range of gain values is not reachable using a single inverting op amp or a single non-inverting op amp?
}

\sol{
We would not be able to reach values between (0, 1), since we found that a non-inverting op amp can only reach values from [1, $\infty$) and an inverting op amp can only reach values from (-$\infty$, 0]. 
}

\item{
How would we construct a circuit using the types op amps we have learned to reach the gain values in this gap? What resistor values would we choose?
}


\sol{
The inverting op amp can always provide the correct magnitude of gain that we want, but the value will always be the negative of what we inputted. We can simply tack on another inverting op amp that does not scale the magnitude and simply reverses the sign! We pass $V_{out}$ as our v In order to not scale the input again, we simply set $R_3 = R_4$; this way, the gain $\frac{R_3}{R_4}$ will equal 1.

Calculate $V_{out}$ in terms of $V_1$ and $V_2$. Assume that $R_1 = R_2$.\\

 \begin{center}
    \begin{circuitikz} 
    \draw (0,0) 
    node[op amp, yscale=-1] (opamp) {}
    (opamp.+) node[left] {}
    to[short] ++(-2, 0)
    to[R = $R_1$] ++(-2,0)
    to[V_ = $V_1$] ++(-2,0)
    to[short] node[ground] {} ++(0,0)
    (opamp.-) node[left] {}
    to[short] ++(-1,0)
    to[short] ++(0,-2)
    to[short] ++(3.5, 0)
    (opamp.out) node[right] {}
    to[R = $R_4$] ++(0,-3)
    to[R = $R_3$] ++(0, -1)

    to[short, l = $V_o$, *-o] ++(0.5, 0);
    
    \draw(-3, 0.5)
    to[short] ++(0, -2)
    to[R, l^ = $R_2$] ++(-2,0)
    to[V_ = $V_2$] ++(-2, 0)
    to[short] node[ground] {} ++(0,0);
    
    \end{circuitikz}
    \end{center}
}

\note{ The steps for calculating $V_{out}$ are: 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Establish negative feedback 
    \item Find $V^+$
    \item Find $V^-$ using golden rules
    \item Write $V_{out}$ in a voltage divider expression with $R_3$, $R_4$, and $V^-$. You can also just plug into the noninverting op amp formula (which is what the solution here does). Just be prepared to derive this formula since students might not have seen it or remember it.
    \item Substitutions
\end{enumerate}
Students like to see "steps" for procedures, so it may be helpful to number your steps as you solve.

\sol{
% To use superposition, we want to consider each of the sources individually. Let's first null out $V_2$ and consider just $V_1$.  Repeating this process again, but this time nulling $V_1$ instead of $V_2$...
Let's look at $V_+$ in this circuit and try to find its value in terms of $V_1$ and $V_2$.
$$V_+ = \frac{\frac{V_1}{R_1}+\frac{V_2}{R_2}}{\frac{1}{R_1}+\frac{1}{R_2}}$$
Assuming $R_1 = R_2$,
$$\frac{V_1 + V_2}{2}$$
This circuit takes the average of the input voltages! So, when we feed in $V_+$ to a non-inverting op-amp, we get
$$V_o = \frac{V_1 + V_2}{2}(1 + \frac{R_4}{R_3})$$
}

\item{
What values should we select for $R_1$, $R_2$, $R_3$, and $R_4$ such that $V_{out} = V_1 + V_2$?
}

\sol{
If we choose $R_3$ and $R_4$ such that the gain is 2, then we get $V_o = V_1 + V_2$. One viable set of values is $R_1 = 1$, $R_2 = 1$, $R_3 = 1$, $R_4 = 1$. $R_1$ and $R_2$ have to equal each other, as established in the previous part, but we need to choose $R_3$ and $R_4$ such that (1 + $\frac{R_4}{R_3}$) equals the number of voltages we are summing up. This cancels out the averaging effect of linking up all the voltages to each other.
}

\item{
What would $V_{o}$ be if we added another voltage $V_3$ in the same configuration as $V_1$ and $V_2$? If we added $V_4$? How would we change the resistor values?
}

\sol{
% We don't have to calculate $V_o$ using superposition again. We can simply follow the pattern that we established in parts (a) and (b) and add *insert here*. This is called a non-inverting voltage summer, which we can use to add up voltages when we design circuits.
If we added another voltage $V_3$, $V_+$ would be $\frac{V_1 + V_2 + V_3}{3}$. This means, to get $V_o = V_1 + V_2 + V_3$, we have to adjust $R_3$ and $R_4$ such that the gain is 3 instead of 2. One possible such combination is $R_3 = 1$ and $R_4 = 2$.
}

\item{
 Alternatively, we could also use an inverting op amp to build an inverting summer. Given $R_1 = R_2 = R_3 = R$, calculate the value of $V_{out}$ given the following circuit:

   \begin{center}
    \begin{circuitikz} 
    \draw (0,0) 
    node[op amp] (opamp) {}
    (opamp.-) node[left] {}
    to[short] ++(-1, 0)
    to[R, l = $R_1$, *-o] ++(-2,0)
    to[short, l = $V_{1}$] ++(0,0) 
    (opamp.+) node[left] {} 
    to[short] node[ground] {} ++(0,-1)
    (opamp.out) node[right] {}
    to[short] ++(0, 1.5)
    to[R, l = $R_3$, i = $i$] ++(-2.4, 0)
    to[short] ++(0,-1)
    (opamp.out) node[right, *-o] {}
    to[short, l = $V_o$, *-o] ++(0.5, 0);
    
    \draw (-2.2, 0.5)
    to[short] ++(0, -2)
    to[R, l = $R_2$, *-o] ++(-2,0)
    to[short, l = $V_{2}$] ++(0,0)
    
    
    \end{circuitikz}
    \end{center}
    
}
\sol{
Let's call the current across $R_1$ $i_1$, and the current across $R_2$ $i_2$. Using KCL at the $V^-$ terminal, we have $i = i_1 + i_2$. The voltage at $V^- = 0$ because of our golden rules. Then, substituting in our values for the currents, we have $$\frac{V_o}{R_3} = \frac{0-V_1}{R_1} + \frac{0-V_2}{R_2}$$
Since $R_1 = R_2 = R_3 = R$, we can simplify this to $$V_o = -V_1 + -V_2$$
\\We see that $V_o$ is just the sum of all the input voltages, except negative. We can apply similar logic as in the previous parts to sum more voltages together.
